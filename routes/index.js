/*
Set up routes here. 

In the wines app, here is where they set up the database
including a mongo server, a mongo BSON and a mongo db. 
They put winedb and wines collection.

put and remove things using mongo methods makes sense! 



OK- seems like we can set up mongoose as usual, and we 
just save things differently than they do.
