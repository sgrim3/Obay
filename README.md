# Obay

Our goal is to create Obay (Ebay for Olin), so that Olin students can buy and sell items on an online marketplace. Currently, the CarpeDiem and Helpme mailing lists get tons of unnecessary emails surrounding buying, selling and giving away items and rides. Obay would condense all of this email traffic into one central location where people could log in, list items they want to sell, claim free items, and buy items using venmo right from the site. It is also possible that this will be integrated with email, so an Oliner could send an email to a particular address to list an item on Obay.
